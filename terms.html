  <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

  <p><em>Effective Date: January 1, 2025</em></p>

  <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
  <p>
    By accessing or using LoanTiger (the "Service"), which is operated by BC Innovation Labs LLC d/b/a LoanTiger ("LoanTiger," "we," "us," or "our"), you ("User," "you," or "your") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Agreement"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our Service.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Overview of the Service</h3>
  <p>
    LoanTiger provides a platform where our artificial intelligence ("AI") tools listen to your calls with mortgage bankers, loan officers, or other lending professionals, and then offer real-time or post-call negotiation tips designed to help you save money on your mortgage. In addition, the Service may assist in securing competing offers from other mortgage lenders, brokers, or financial institutions.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Payment Terms and Conditions</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>3.1 Credit Card Information.</strong> You agree to provide valid and current credit card information when you register for our Service. Although you must provide a credit card to use the Service, you will not be charged unless and until you use the Service beyond mere registration. Usage includes conducting an AI-assisted call and checking the box indicating you agree to the resulting payment structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3.2 Service Fees.</strong> If you choose to utilize our negotiation services, and based on the AI-processed call transcript or relevant uploaded documentation, you agree to pay LoanTiger an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the total amount you saved on your mortgage deal ("Service Fee"). The amount saved is determined by comparing the original terms offered to you prior to using the Service with the improved terms obtained as a result of our AI-assisted negotiation services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3.3 Payment Timing.</strong> Charges will be applied to the credit card you have on file 30 days after the call transcript indicates you took a deal using our Service. If you upload documentation stating that the loan will close on a date later than 30 days from the transcript date, the charge may be postponed accordingly. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3.4 Disputed Savings Amount.</strong> If you believe the transcript-based savings calculation is incorrect, you may upload documentation (such as a loan estimate or signed disclosures from your lender) proving the error. Upon receipt of such documentation, we will review the evidence and recalculate or verify the amount saved. If the documentation shows the deal fell through entirely, your charges will be canceled. However, this cancellation is subject to a fraud investigation by LoanTiger.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3.5 Fraudulent Non-Payment.</strong> If, after you upload documentation stating the deal fell through, LoanTiger discovers through publicly available property records or third-party data sources (such as Redfin or Zillow) that you proceeded with the purchase of the property or closed on the loan in question within approximately 30 days of the anticipated closing date, you consent to be charged the full Service Fee based on the previously determined savings. By using the Service, you authorize LoanTiger to perform necessary checks against public and third-party data sources.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Data Collection and Use</h3>
  <p>
    LoanTiger collects and processes various categories of data, including but not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Call Transcripts:</strong> AI-generated transcripts of your conversations with mortgage professionals, including any personally identifiable information (PII) you share during these calls.</li>
    <li><strong>Uploaded Documents:</strong> Mortgage-related documents you provide, such as loan estimates, closing disclosures, and supporting paperwork, which may contain financial and personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li><strong>Property and Transaction Data:</strong> Public property records, third-party real estate website data, and other market data used to verify transactions, fraud check, and confirm loan closings.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal and Behavioral Data:</strong> Information about hobbies, family discussions, interests, and other personal details gleaned from call transcripts that may be incidental to the mortgage negotiation process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>
    By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree to the following privacy practices:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.1 Personal Financial Information.</strong> We understand the sensitivity of your financial information. LoanTiger will not sell your personal financial information (such as credit card numbers, full Social Security Numbers, or detailed loan terms) to any third parties. However, we may share such information with service providers, processors, and other parties as needed to facilitate your requested transaction and manage risk, as permitted by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.2 Non-Financial Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</strong> Personally identifiable information that is incidental to the mortgage discussion (for example, mentions of family members, hobbies, or other personal interests not directly related to the mortgage terms) may be sold or disclosed to third parties. This means that some parts of your conversation that do not pertain to your financial transaction could potentially be monetized.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.3 Sharing with Mortgage Competitors and Lead Generation.</strong> The user data, including call transcripts and certain PII, may be shared directly with competing mortgage companies to solicit immediate offers that could save you money. You also agree that we may sell or transfer your information as a lead to other mortgage companies or financial institutions when you use our Service. If you do not wish to be contacted by these parties, you must notify us in writing, though we cannot retroactively retract data already shared.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.4 Data Retention.</strong> We retain transcripts, property records, and all uploaded mortgage documents for as long as necessary to: (a) provide the Service; (b) comply with legal and regulatory obligations; (c) resolve disputes; (d) enforce this Agreement; and (e) maintain records of transactions for auditing and compliance purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.5 Data Security.</strong> We implement reasonable security measures to protect against the unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data. However, no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure. By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept these inherent risks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.6 International Data Transfers.</strong> If you access the Service from outside the United States, your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States or other countries where we or our partners operate. Such countries may not have equivalent data protection laws. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your data in these jurisdictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.7 Your Rights.</strong> Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to request access to, rectify, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to object to or request restrictions on certain processing activities. To exercise any of these rights, please contact our DPO, Nick Rackley, at <a href="mailto:nick@loan-tiger.com">nick@loan-tiger.com</a> or call +1 (717) 579-3941. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
